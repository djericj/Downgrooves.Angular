Downgrooves.com is my personal music project website. As a DJ and music producer for over 25 years, I have ammased an extensive collection of original music, dj sets and performance YouTube videos.
This site collects all those resources into a single space.

The site is a Single Page Application written in Angular 13. The site accesses a .NET Core 5 WebAPI for most of it's data. The WebAPI portion can be found on my GitHub at github.com/djericj/Downgrooves.Core5

This site and it's companion projects (Downgrooves.Core5, Downgrooves.Mobile) are full participants in the Software Development Lifecycle on Azure DevOps.  Through Azure DevOps, the site is configured with automatic build and deployments to a Development and a Production environment.
